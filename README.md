User support files and documentation for Sinterpixels

This repo is for freely available support files for Sinterpixels, a scriptable macOS application for drawing shapes and manipulating pixels.

Sinterpixels gets its name because it is an app with a Scripting INTERface for generation of pixel-based artwork.  There's some use of a graphical UI as well, but much of the value of the app lives in its scriptability.

The contents of this repo are some sample data files in the data directory, some sample scripts in the scripts directory, and some overview documentation on how to use Sinterpixels.

Here's a tour of some of the features of the app:  If you are new to the app, it is strongly recommended to start by going in order through the first three links, "Opening a File", "Using the Scripting Interface"
