##  Layers

Every document has a canvas, which consists of a background of pixels and an overlay of different shapes

A layer is essentially another canvas, which can have its own size, its own bitmap background and its own set of shapes.  Layers are positioned relative to the main canvas, but they can move independently of the main canvas

If multiple layers are defined, they stack on top of each other.
