## Opening a File

After launching the app, Choose "Open" from the file menu and choose a file in either the .jpeg or .png formats. A new document will open with the canvas background of the image filled in with the file you've chose, and the size of the canvas matching the size of the image

Alternatively, choose "New" from the file menu to open an empty file. You'll be prompted to choose the dimensions of your empty canvas.
